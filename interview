Write a function that accepts a positive integer. We will perform a series of operations on that input until we terminate.

While the input is greater than 1, we will divide it by two if it is/ even, otherwise, we will multiply it by 3 and add 1.

We will do this until we reduce the input value to 1. The final output should be all the integers we see between the input and 1, inclusive.



const reduceFunction = (input: number): number =>{
    let output = 0
    if(input<1){
        response 400
        throw new Error(`Invalid input provided ${inpunt}`)
    } 
    if(input>1){
        const isEven = input%2==0;
        if(isEven){
            output = input / 2
        } else {
            output = (input * 3) + 1
        }
    }
    if(output === 1){
        return
    } else {
        200
        reduceFunction(output)
    }
